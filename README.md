# Chatbot

Type in a message and send it to a LLM to either print or speak the response.

I'll use the openAI api to send the input/output
I'll store the dialogue in the LLM object

Maybe in the future I'll host my own LLM, but for now we just have ChatGPT.

Uses Cobra and Viper for configuration.
Stores a config file in `~/.chatbot/congif`.
